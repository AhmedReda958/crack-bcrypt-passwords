- Node.js
- npm

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development environment running:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourrepository.git`
2. Navigate into the directory: `cd yourrepository`
3. Install the dependencies: `npm install`

### Usage

To run the script, use the following command:
